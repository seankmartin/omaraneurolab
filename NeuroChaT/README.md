# NeuroChaT

NeuroChaT (RRID:SCR_018020) is an open-source neuron characterisation toolbox. It is described in our paper on [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-196).

## Installation

Python version 3.5 upwards is required to install neurochat. Installation steps are listed in detail below:

### Option 1: Use Pip

Open command prompt and type/paste the following. It is recommended to install neurochat to a virtual environment (E.g. using virtualenv), if doing so, activate it before typing these commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/shanemomara/omaraneurolab.git
cd omaraneurolab\NeuroChaT
pip install .
python neurochat_gui\neurochat_ui.py
```

### Option 2: Use Pip, but don't install NeuroChaT

Open command prompt and type/paste the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/shanemomara/omaraneurolab.git
cd omaraneurolab\NeuroChaT
pip install -r requirements.txt
python modify_neuro_path.py
python neurochat_gui\neurochat_ui.py
```

This method only allows the GUI program to function, any other file will need to modify the python path to use neurochat.

## Getting Started

The best ways to get started with NeuroChaT are:

1. For using the UI, download the [executable file for Windows](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and check out the [user manual](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/blob/master/docs/NeuroChaT%20User%20Guide.pdf).
2. For using the Python Code, checkout the nice [notebook](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/blob/master/notebooks/api_use_guide.ipynb) made by Md Nurul Islam, a [repository](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT_API_Scripts) containing a set of scripts using NeuroChat by Sean Martin, and [examples](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/tree/master/examples) in this repository.

We are open to collaborators, questions, etc. so feel free to get in touch!

## Documentation

See the docs folder for a pdf user guide which should be the first port of call. There is also html docs available for the neurochat package, which can be accessed by opening docs/index.html in a browser, or from the NeuroChaT UI help menu, or on [Github Pages](https://seankmartin.github.io/NeuroChaT/docs/html/neurochat/index.html).

## Open Science Framework Storage

Sample hdf5 datasets and results are stored on OSF, at https://osf.io/kqz8b/files/.
